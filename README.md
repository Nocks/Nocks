### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a diligent self-taught developer with 3+ years of experience and proven knowledge of software development, with a passion for Python and front-end web development. Aiming to leverage my skills in a world-class software development team.

I have worked on small to medium-scale projects both on the front-end and back-end as a remote freelance developer. However, I've developed more love for front-end stuff.

I also love reading, photography, forex trading, innovation, and farming!

Technologies I'm familiar with are:

- Python/Django
- HTML
- CSS/SCSS
- Javascript/ES6
- React
- PostgreSQL
- Git

I'm currently looking to contribute my skills to a team where I can prove my front-end skills while growing in my capabilities. If you are looking for a competent, goal-oriented developer, kindly send me an email via enock.addey@gmail.com.
